# Secret Word Game

This is a simple word guessing game in Python. The player needs to guess a secret word letter by letter. If the entered letter is present in the secret word, it is revealed; otherwise, an asterisk is displayed in its place. The player wins when all the letters of the secret word are revealed.

## Functioning:

- The code prompts the player to enter a letter.
- If more than one letter is entered, the code requests a single letter again.
- Correct letters are accumulated and displayed in the formed word.
- The game continues until the player correctly guesses all the letters of the secret word.
- Upon winning, the number of attempts is displayed along with the secret word.
